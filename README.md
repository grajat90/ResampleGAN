### Resample LQ images to HQ using Generative Adversarial Networks

## Work to be done

The following models have been created for rough reference:

They have to be implemented, and played with in terms of various parameters.

## Tools:

We'll be working with these currently for rapid prototyping and realising the models:

- [ ] Tensorflow
- [ ] Keras
- [ ] Pandas
- [ ] Numpy
- [ ] Scikit Learn
- [ ] Anything else as seen fit
      In fututre, the best approach will be hardcoded without using keras or tensorflow
